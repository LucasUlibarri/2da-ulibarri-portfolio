                        BlackSnake (AUST) is a Melbourne based company that manufactures recovery ropes for various industries such as mining, 4x4, military, agricultural and others.

                        My goal during my time at BlackSnake was to create a platform where they can have their wide range of products available to them, taking into account the difficulty of generating a shop that takes into consideration the dual axis of customisation they require (length and tonnage).

Apart from this, as I was the only designer in the team, my tasks ranged from gathering information and evaluating it together with the other team members, to producing high quality UX and UI solutions through different methodologies and tools.</p>

                        During the period in which I worked as a UI designer in the team my tasks were to design and add value to the proposals presented by the UX team and generate a design proposal that followed the aesthetic guidelines already established, perform user testing of the UI components.
                        It was thanks to this opportunity that I discovered my passion for web and application design.</p>
