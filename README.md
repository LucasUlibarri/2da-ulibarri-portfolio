# Codehouse Portfolio Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Codehouse project repository! In this project, I am designing and developing a new version of my personal portfolio website. The primary goal of this project is to showcase my skills and experience as a UX/UI designer and front-end developer based in Buenos Aires.

## Project Objectives

1. **Redesign Portfolio**: Create a modern, responsive, and visually appealing portfolio website that highlights my work and projects.
2. **Learn and Implement Sass**: Utilize Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) to enhance my CSS workflow, making the styles more modular, maintainable, and scalable.
3. **Improve HTML & CSS Skills**: Enhance my overall front-end development skills by implementing best practices in HTML5 and CSS3.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I have significantly improved my web development skills, particularly in the following areas:

- **Sass**: By using Sass, I learned how to write more efficient and reusable CSS. This included working with variables, mixins, and functions, which helped streamline the styling process.
- **Responsive Design**: I applied responsive design principles to ensure the portfolio looks great on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Bootstrap**: I leveraged Bootstrap's grid system and components to create a flexible and responsive layout, speeding up the development process.
- **HTML & CSS Mastery**: This project has given me deeper insights into HTML and CSS, including the latest features and best practices, enhancing my ability to create clean, semantic, and accessible markup.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main landing page of the portfolio.
- **about.html**: A page detailing my background, skills, and experiences.
- **play.html**: A showcase of my experimental projects and designs.
- **contact.html**: A contact page for potential clients and collaborators to reach out.
- **styles**: Contains all Sass files and compiled CSS.
  - **main.scss**: The main Sass file importing all partials.
  - **_variables.scss**: Sass variables for colors, fonts, and other design tokens.
  - **_mixins.scss**: Reusable Sass mixins.
  - **_principal.scss**: Base styles for the project.
  - **_components.scss**: Styles for various components like buttons, cards, etc.
